(2, 'Acne: Beyond the Simple Pimple', 'Around 80 percent of people struggle with acne between the ages of 11 and 30, according to the National Institutes of Health, so it’s extremely common for both teens and adults. To start managing your acne, get the skin(ny) on causes, treatment options and lifestyle changes that may help. ', 'What is Acne?\r\nAcne is a very common skin disorder for teens and adults. It’s caused when a skin pore becomes clogged. Essentially, a “pore” is the visible part of a pilosebaceous unit in your skin. Each unit contains an oil-producing sebaceous gland, a canal and a tiny hair follicle. When the oil that travels up the hair follicle gets trapped by dead skin cells, bacteria grows and results in acne. More oil (sebum) is made when you reach puberty, which is why acne flares up during the teenage years. \r\n\r\nAcne pimples fall into different groups:\r\n\r\nWhiteheads: Sealed over pores with a white top\r\nBlackheads: Pimples with black tops – this is not caused by dirt but by the oil (sebum) being exposed to the air \r\nPustules: Pimples that are red and infected on the bottom with pus on the top \r\nPapules: Small, sensitive pink bumps \r\nNodules: Hard, large, and painful pimples deep in the skin \r\nCysts: Pimples that are pus-filled and formed deep in the skin, which unfortunately, often cause scars \r\nWhat Can Treat Acne?\r\nAcne that is less severe can generally be treated at home with over the counter (OTC) remedies. Don’t expect instant results; it can take four to eight weeks to have noticeable change. A skin care product that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can help to clear your skin.\r\n\r\nIf your acne is still bothering you, you should go to your doctor or dermatologist for treatment. Waiting it out and hoping it gets better can leave you with scarring, so don’t be embarrassed to get help.\r\n\r\nIf you go to a dermatologist, depending on your case, you’ll be given treatments that you either apply on your skin (topical) or a pill to swallow (oral antibiotics) that treats your whole body. Common topical treatments contain prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide, a retinoid, antibiotic or salicylic acid. If you have red and swollen acne, you may have to take a pill (generally in combination with the cream) that may contain antibiotics, birth control (to manage hormones) or isotretinoin (the only prescription to work on all types of acne, but that does have side effects). \r\n\r\nIn addition to prescriptions, a dermatologist can also perform procedures in the office to help your acne and prevent scarring. These include laser and other light therapy, chemical peels and acne removal. \r\n\r\nYour dermatologist has many tools at hand to help you. Your doctor will determine what you need, and while he or she can’t promise that you’ll never have another pimple, you’ll get help to manage your acne. Often, acne under treatment will get worse before it gets better, but be patient: it will improve. \r\n\r\nCan Lifestyle Changes Help?\r\nAcne small\r\nWhile lifestyle changes may not erase your acne, they can benefit you overall, and may be good for your skin. Experts disagree on whether diet changes can treat acne, but choosing to eat less sugar and refined carbohydrates is good for everyone. In addition, some suggest cutting dairy, since dairy products contain hormones that may jolt your own hormonal responses, increasing oil production that results in acne.\r\n\r\nDaily Tips for Acne Care and Prevention\r\nIn addition to eating a healthier diet, you can make daily changes that can help you to have healthier, clearer skin:\r\n\r\nWash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser, and also after sweating.\r\nUse your fingertips to apply the cleanser (rough surfaces can irritate your skin and make your acne worse).\r\nShampoo your hair often and regularly. The oil from your hair can also make your acne worse. Also, keep your hands off of your face during the day.\r\n[pulled quote begins] Don’t pop your pimples because this can cause infection and scarring. [pulled quote ends]\r\nDon’t tan – in the sun or on tanning beds. While UV rays damage skin in general, your acne medication may make you especially sensitive. \r\nRead your skin care labels. Choose skin care products that are gentle and non-abrasive. Choose make-up that is water-based and oil-free. \r\nRemember: While no one likes it, most people have dealt with acne to some extent. With help and by keeping up on your treatment plan, you can get your skin under control and see it become more clear, bright and healthy. ', '2021-05-13', '68', 'Paul Bradshaw', 1),

(7, '3 Mindset Techniques to Reclaim Your Sleep', 'If you\'re looking to sleep better with less effort, here are 3 important mindset shifts.', 'In an ideal world, you wouldn’t have to think so much about your sleep because it would just happen. You’d fall asleep easily, stay asleep through the night, and wake up feeling ready to take on your day. You’d have energy not just to survive your day but to thrive. You’d feel productive and focused at work, connected to your friends and family, and fully engaged in your life.\r\nBut so often, we sabotage ourselves. We become frustrated with our inability to sleep, with our low energy. We try to improve our sleep but either can’t find the time or discipline to follow good sleep hygiene practices. Or maybe we have great self-control; we do “all the things” we’re supposed to, but despite our hard work, they’re still not working.\r\n\r\nAs a sleep wellness coach, I talk to a lot of people about their sleep, and here’s what I see: until people make some important mindset shifts about their sleep and energy, they continue to work hard and struggle. \r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to sleep better with less effort, here are 3 important mindset shifts you’ll need to make.\r\n1. Change how you talk about your sleep\r\nFirst, you must acknowledge that your words, whether said to yourself in your mind or vocalized aloud, influence your experience.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have trouble falling asleep in the amount of time you feel is reasonable, does your mind immediately say, “here we go again! Another night of me lying here awake!”\r\nHow you talk about your sleep and your energy reflects what you believe to be true. Your language has the power to solidify a random one or two-night experience into a story. Do this enough, and it hardens into an identity: “I’m just a poor sleeper.” \r\n2. Decide on one sleep-supporting behavior, then don’t look back\r\nSome have reported that as adults, we make close to 35,000 decisions every day. Some of these are conscious. Others aren’t. \r\n\r\nYou probably don’t feel the need to make a conscious decision to brush your teeth twice a day. It’s part of your routine because at some point in the past, likely many years ago, you decided that brushing your teeth was important.\r\nMy point is this: you made this decision consciously. Once. Then you keep that commitment to yourself; you don’t re-decide each time. Brushing your teeth is simply part of your routine. It doesn’t take any energy other than the act itself.\r\n\r\nI’ll bet there’s one thing you’re doing, one lifestyle habit you have that you know, deep down in your gut, that stops you from getting refreshing sleep.\r\nSo decide once to do that one thing you really know you should do, but don’t. Decide: “I’m a person who brushes her teeth.” Related to sleep, that may sound like, “I’m a person who shuts off her phone at 7 pm.” One and done. \r\n 3. Depressurize the act of sleeping, then surrender\r\nI talk with tired and frustrated people about their sleep every day. They have good reasons to be upset; they’ve been sleep deprived for a long, long time. They may even have great sleep hygiene practices. They’ve tried “all the things!” and they’re still not sleeping. Why is that?\r\n\r\nAs someone who self-identifies with these labels, I hope you’ll smile about me sharing this hard truth. People who work with me 1-1 have certain qualities: they self-describe as:\r\ncontrol freaks,\r\n\r\ntype-A’s, \r\n\r\nhigh-achievers (with off-the-charts standards for themselves), \r\n\r\nfixers (who work hard to “think through” and “figure out” problems--for themselves and many others), and/or \r\n\r\nperfectionists.\r\n\r\nI once spoke with a woman who listened to a sleep hypnosis recording. She said, “I tried so hard to do everything he said, but at the end of it, I was still awake.”\r\nThe counter-intuitive thing about sleep is that the harder we try, the worse our sleeping gets. The more pressure you put on yourself to fall asleep or back to sleep quickly at night, the more stress and anxiety you create. Stress and anxiety build up and translate into vigilance. \r\n\r\nVigilance is what keeps your eyes popping open, your body beaming with energy, your mind racing even as you lay down to sleep. Even if the previously mentioned qualities are an asset to your daily professional life, they are not directly applicable to your nighttime woes. In the worst case, daytime overuse of these qualities sabotages your sleep.\r\nSleep comes easily when your body and mind let go of the day and surrender to the night. Control, stress, anxiety, and vigilance are antidotes to surrender. \r\n\r\nIf you want to “work” on your sleep, the best course of action can be to practice reducing the pressure you put on yourself. While that pressure may be directly related to sleeping right now, it can also be helpful to use small daily tasks to develop this depressurizing skill. Where are you pushing to excel, adding pressure to something that’s neither truly urgent nor important?\r\nThe more you see and take those daily opportunities to ease off the gas pedal, the easier it will be to put the brakes on vigilance and surrender into natural sleep. \r\n', '2021-02-18', '81', ' Natasha Wynarczyk', 3),
(8, '5 Habits That Made Me a Millionaire by 25', 'Practice these five habits to unlock your own financial success.', 'You don\'t need superpowers to become a millionaire. Believe me, I became one by the age of 25, and I started from very humble beginnings. When I was a teenager, I began to study rich people: their behavior and what made them more successful than other people.\r\n\r\nI found patterns and began to change my habits to align with those of millionaires, later becoming a self-made millionaire myself. Here are the top five habits millionaires share.   \r\n\r\n1. See the best in every situation \r\nWhen bad things happen, you can either see the best and stay positive, or let it get you down and distract you from your goals. Being positive is a choice, and it becomes a habit. As a property investor, I am always looking for lucrative investment opportunities. When the market crashes, most people become very negative towards the idea of investing and wait for it to boom.\r\n2. Stop caring about the opinions of others \r\n\r\nMost people spend their entire lives holding back on their dreams because they are afraid of being judged by other people. When I first started buying real estate and went full-time as a property entrepreneur, there were lots of old school friends and even family members who thought I was crazy. They would ask me why I didn\'t have a \"proper job\" and warn me of all the risks associated with entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nI thought that once I started making good money, everybody would see the light and cheer me on. Sadly, even after proving my business successful, many friends still judged me and said I was now too \"money minded.\"\r\n\r\nIf your friends judge you, how much more will your enemies? In becoming a millionaire, I have had to evict tenants, fire employees and take business from my competition. This has resulted in people calling me far worse things than \"money minded.\" Sometimes you have to be tough in business. You will not make millions of pounds while trying to please everybody all of the time.\r\n\r\nRelated: The Ins and Outs of Raising Money From Friends and Family\r\n\r\n3. Love what you do \r\nThere is no quick way to become a millionaire; you have to put in the time and energy. When I started in real estate, I used to work over 100 hours per week, and some months, I would lose money. If I had not enjoyed the work, it would have been unbearable, but because I loved what I was doing, it did not even feel like I was working. I would spend every possible hour viewing properties, negotiating deals and transforming run-down buildings into beautiful homes for people.\r\n\r\nAs it so happens, this profession can be extremely lucrative, but I loved learning the ropes and immersing myself in the industry. I used other people\'s money to do it, and the feeling of building my own empire was truly addictive. \r\n\r\nI do not believe you can make millions without being addicted to your business and loving what you do. It is vital to choose a profession you are passionate about. Then, working will be a habitual joy, and you will not burn out trying to get rich. \r\n4. Always replace yourself\r\n\r\nYou need to find people to manage the everyday running of your business so that you have the time to scale it into the millions. After a couple of years of being an entrepreneur, I was doing everything myself, from finding the properties, dealing with the refurbishments and managing the tenants to carrying out the book-keeping.\r\n\r\nBy the time I had six properties, it had become almost a full-time job just to sustain what I had already built. This is when I began to replace myself with team members, freeing up my time. Once I had systemized the business, I didn\'t sit back and enjoy the passive income: I actively grew the company. \r\n\r\nYou will never become a millionaire without having a good team around you, and you can only do that my learning the habit of replacing yourself. This means systemizing everything you do, then training others to do your job. You can duplicate this process until your company is making millions. \r\n\r\nRelated: 17 Passive Income Ideas for Increasing Your Cash Flow\r\n\r\n5. Practice gratitude\r\nMake a habit of being thankful for all the things good in your business and in your life. When you do this, in an almost magical way, more and more good things will keep coming your way. Being grateful will also put you in a good state of mind, and you will much more pleasant to be around.\r\n\r\nI noticed that many of my business competitors would talk about their tenants in a derogatory way. They would jokingly say that they were \"allergic\" to tenants. This surprised me because their tenants were the very people who were paying for their luxurious lifestyles. I decided to practice having a grateful attitude towards my tenants, which resulted in them staying in my properties much longer and paying their rent on time. A small gift at Christmas would go a long way, and my habit of gratitude began to spill into all aspects of my business.\r\n\r\nI noticed that not only was I much happier, but also my customers were loyal, and my staff were happy to work harder. Gratitude is a habit that all successful business owners must learn. \r\n', '2021-05-09', '80', 'Mc Murphy', 3),

Luckily he had taught himself a few things in the months before meeting Elayna, who was working for a travel company in Greece, but his journey was not without the occasional mishap. He recalls one night in Dubrovnik, Croatia, when the boat – already slowly taking on water from a hidden leak – was swamped by a wake from a fishing boat. Riley awoke to a cabin awash with water and frantically Googled: “My boat is sinking, what do I do?”\r\n\r\nGoogle responded, somewhat unhelpfully: “All boats are sinking.

We’ve seen the difficulties of life at sea, watching them deal with injuries and the boredom of spending weeks offshore when you’ve read all your books.\r\n\r\nMaybe what really compels is simply their competence and equanimity; there is no whinging on board La Vagabonde.

Luckily they were offered a spot at Gurney’s Newport Resort & Marina, when the dockmaster, Sean Kellershon – who has been following their adventures for years – saw them heading north after months in the Bahamas. “They just seemed like really cool people,” he says.\r\n\r\nAs we chat, Lenny gnaws on an apple and plays with a USB cord. He has barely any baby gear, and even fewer toys – a Jolly Jumper; a baby seat; a stick, a triangle and a pair of tiny cymbals. “To explain the obvious,” Riley says, “boat living is enforced minimalism.”\r\n\r\nRiley wears what looked like a Star Wars T-shirt, except that Mark Hamill’s face is replaced with his own, and Carrie Fisher’s with Elayna’s. Under Darth Vader’s helmet is Lenny. Designed by a fan, it’s La Vagabonde merchandise made by an ecologically conscious company in Los Angeles. The couple sell shirts, hoodies, totes, sailing guides and cookbooks they have written from their website, all mailed in compostable envelopes.\r\n\r\n    I had always hung around guys who didn’t have any goals, and here was this sailor guy who just got stuff done. I knew he was going to go far, and I wanted to be a part of that\r\n\r\nElayna\r\n\r\nBut most of their income comes from patrons – about 3,500 subscribers who pay between $3 and $10 (£2-£8) for early access to the videos, plus other perks, like the chance to meet the couple for dinner and a sail, perhaps, if La Vagabonde comes to their town.\r\n\r\nLiving costs aboard are moderate, with Elayna estimating that they might spend $400 (£310) on groceries every two weeks, to supplement the fish they catch themselves, and the same amount every two months or so on diesel fuel. They run their engine as little as possible and charge their batteries with solar and wind power.\r\n\r\nStill, boat maintenance is expensive. Conventional wisdom says that, once a boat is more than two years old, it costs 15 per cent of its purchase price every year. Their elegant and airy new boat, a 48-ft Outremer, is about two-and-a-half years old, and lists at over £600,000. Having seen one in Los Roques, an archipelago off Venezuela, Riley wooed the company, and a boat was specifically designed for the couple, and a lease arranged so they could pay monthly at a slightly discounted rate.\r\n\r\nOn forums like Reddit, fans debate the couple’s good fortune. Have they sold out? Are they still relatable? Could you learn the craft of sailing from their videos if they’re in such a high-end craft? But as one poster notes, “ People think that just anyone can get a GO PRO and do a YouTube Channel, get on Patreon and make hay. It just does not work this way. It actually takes quite a bit of on-screen talent and editing skills to get viewers ... I’ll admit it. I just like these people.”\r\nForbes\' Highest-Paid YouTubers of 2016\r\nShow all 10\r\n1.

Riley skipped university and started a business digging trenches for the Australian Phone Company before going to work on oil rigs for eight years. Between three-week shifts, he backpacked around the world, intent on saving his money. At the start of a trip through South America, he broke his neck in the surf at Rio’s Copacabana beach. The surgery temporarily paralysed his vocal cords, and he couldn’t speak or work for six months.\r\n\r\nDespite having sailed only once, a miserable three days beating into the wind off Southern Australia, Riley says it was his dream to buy a boat and learn how to handle it. “OK, so you’re going to be alone forever, then,” a friend predicted darkly\r\n\r\nElayna, meanwhile – a tomboy with two older brothers, who learned to ride a motorcycle before she ever got on a bike – had learned to drive a motorboat during high school, where her curriculum included marine studies and aquaculture. She then worked as a divemaster in Queensland, living in a Kia van that she had painted and fixed up – until the fateful trip to Ios, where she met Riley.\r\n[boat1-copy.png]\r\nThe couple’s young son lives with them on the boat (YouTube/Sailing La Vagabonde)\r\n\r\nThe pair had known each other barely more than a month when he said, “It would be great if you’d sail the world with me.” Elayna did just that, selling all her belongs and leaving her job in Ios two weeks early. “I had always hung around guys who didn’t have any goals, and here was this sailor guy who just got stuff done,” she says. “I knew he was going to go far, and I wanted to be a part of that.”\r\n\r\n“What about the waves? What about the sharks?” Elayna remembers her mother asking. “Deep-ocean sailing, for her, was a combination of Jaws and The Perfect Storm.” It was one reason why Elayna began posting reassuring footage of their trip.\r\n\r\n    I thought people would be interested. I wanted to put our videos up on YouTube but Riley wouldn’t let me\r\n\r\nElayna\r\n\r\nThe first videos are very much like home movies, charting progress south from the Mediterranean to Cape Verde and then across the Atlantic. “I saw something good in what we were doing,” Elayna says, “and I thought people would be interested. I wanted to put our videos up on YouTube but Riley wouldn’t let me.” But by the time they reached Malta a month later, he had relented. Within a few weeks of its posting, their first video had reached over 70,000 views.\r\n\r\n“She was flipping out, and I was like, ‘Cool, but what does it mean?’ For five months, it was still a hobby,” Riley says.\r\n\r\nFunds were low after their first Atlantic crossing, and they were broke by the time they reached Grenada. As they prepared to fly home to work, having hauled the boat out of the water, they announced their plans in a video to let their community know that would be the last for a while. Subscribers turned into paying patrons by the hundreds. It took some time, however, for Riley to wrap his head around the idea of being crowdfunded. “That was really hard for me,” he says, “taking money from strangers.”\r\nRead more\r\n\r\n    The YouTube nonnas making pasta cool\r\n    YouTube comes under criticism for ‘demonetising queer content’\r\n    The man who gives an ASMR boyfriend experience on YouTube\r\n    YouTuber Trisha Paytas faces backlash after claiming she is trans\r\n\r\nThese days their videos are more polished, thanks to the use of a drone plus multiple cameras and editing help. The filming process typically takes three days, and since Lenny’s birth, Elayna has hired an editor to make the initial cuts, although she puts the finishing touches on before posting. They hope to keep sailing, boat-school Lenny and continue to make videos – Kardashian-like, but wholesome and afloat.\r\n\r\nElayna has also designed a swimwear line, Vaga Bella Swim, made from recycled, ocean-harvested plastic trash, and plans to donate the proceeds to a charity. “I’ve always been dreaming of the perfect bikini,” she says. “Something that looks a little bit sexy, but that you can spearfish and dive in without having a body part fall out.” The couple also hope to turn their boat into a vessel with zero or low emissions.\r\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\r\n\r\nThey are currently sailing to Charleston, South Carolina, where they will leave the boat with friends for two months so that they can return home for Christmas. They’ll then return to take the boat through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific to Australia, a first for them, and circumnavigate their home country, with all the challenges that will bring.\r\n\r\n“One year on a boat is like 10 on land,” Riley said. “Now, it’s as if we’ve been married for 50 years. If you’re not sure about a partner, take them sailing.”\r\n\r\n© New York Times', '2020-06-09', '6', 'Penelope Green', 3),

Only patients with acne treated with isotretinoin (n=1,171,615) or oral antibiotics (n=7,875,279) were included in this study. Oral antibiotics included doxycycline, tetracycline, or minocycline.\r\nThe investigators compared the 2 treatment groups in regard to responses on the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and Kessler 6-Item Psychological Distress Scale (K6). Both the PHQ-2 and K6 were completed during treatment.\r\nIn an analysis adjusted for socio-demographic factors, patients administered isotretinoin had significantly fewer depressive symptoms compared with patients who took oral antibiotics, according to the mean PHQ-2 scores (0.280 vs 0.656, respectively; difference, 0.337; 95% CI, -0.503 to -0.171; P <.001). In addition, patients with acne who took isotretinoin also had less psychological distress, as measured by the K6 scores (2.494 vs 3.433; difference, 0.759; 95% CI, -1.493 to -0.024; P =.043).\r\n\r\nA primary limitation of this study was the lack of direct assessment of acne severity, which limited the investigators’ ability to determine whether isotretinoin-treated patients had worse acne at baseline compared with those treated with oral antibiotics.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the relationship between isotretinoin’s efficacy profile and the therapy’s anti-depressant effect, the researchers also suggest that the drug’s ability to decrease neuroinflammation could also explain its effects on mental health. Studies have “shown that inflammation plays a larger role in acne, and recent reports have linked inflammation with neuropsychiatric disorders,” the investigators wrote.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: Several study authors declared affiliations with the pharmaceutical industry.

On Friday, the World Health Organization’s director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed worry about the unfolding crisis.\r\n\r\n“India remains hugely concerning,” he said at a news briefing. “But it’s not only India that has emergency needs. Nepal, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Egypt are just some of the countries that are dealing with spikes in cases and hospitalizations.”\r\nHumanitarian aid groups say this is just the tip of the iceberg for Nepal, the landlocked Himalayan nation of more than 28 million known for its serene landscapes, colorful culture and Mount Everest.\r\n\r\n“We are in the initial phase,” said Sushila Pandit, a Nepalese aid worker with Mercy Corps, an international nongovernmental aid group. “I think the condition will be more critical in the the coming days.”\r\n\r\nThe positivity rate is now at 45 percent, with nearly 9,000 new cases daily, an increase of about 3,000 percent from last month, according to Our World in Data, a research group. Deaths are rising sharply, too. In April, five deaths were reported per day. The most recent seven-day average had risen to 174 deaths per day.\r\nLast week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that all travelers should avoid Nepal and a lockdown was extended in the Kathmandu valley until May 27.\r\n\r\nMany in the country are blaming the skyrocketing cases on a surge of Nepalese workers returning to the country from India, after lockdowns there left them with no work or income.\r\n“These new variants have come very quickly,” Getman said. “What’s particularly surprising and unexpected is how much more virulent they are and how much more sick people are getting.”\r\n\r\nThe surging cases are overloading an already fragile health care system that doesn’t have enough ventilators, oxygen or even doctors to take care of the sick. In Nepal, there are just eight doctors for every 10,000 people. The United States has more than three times that number, according to the WHO.\r\n\r\n“Health care centers are at max capacity and so people are unable to find a hospital bed,” Getman said. “Even my own staff at Mercy Corps, when we have had sick staff, they’ve been unable to get a doctor on the telephone.”\r\n\r\nIt’s something Niko Ruwe, an American living in Nepal, has watched unfold around her.\r\n\r\n“They’re very overburdened,” Ruwe said. “There’s no ventilators. There aren’t enough masks or protective wear for nurses and there certainly are not enough doctors and nurses here to deal with this.”\r\n\r\nEnchanted with the culture and beauty of the country, Ruwe said doesn’t want to leave, even though she’s unvaccinated, like most of the country, which was forced to halt its vaccination program because it ran out of shots.

About 7 percent have had one, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.\r\nThe once bustling streets of the nation’s capitol, Kathmandu, remain quiet. The city and much of the rest of the country are under lockdown, as the country works to get the virus under control. But now many are left wondering whether these measures are too little, too late.\r\n\r\n“The projection modeling rates show us as potentially having a more severe impact than India,\" Getman said. “Our health infrastructure is nowhere near as strong as India.

It\'s now been found in at least 44 countries, including the United States, where about 3 percent of the sequenced samples are a version of the B.1.617, according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n\r\nHow contagious is it?\r\nCurrently, the most contagious form of the coronavirus was reported to be the B.1.117 that has been dominant in the U.K. and Europe since the winter and now makes up three-quarters of coronavirus infections in the U.S.\r\n\r\nLast week, the B.1.617 variant, first found in India, was officially classified as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization,, which detailed in a report the variant and its three lineages — versions that differ slightly in the mutations in the virus\'s spike protein.\r\n\r\nEarly data suggests that one of the lineages, B.1.617.2, which has been detected most frequently in the U.S. and the U.K., may be the lineage associated with the greatest transmissibility. An expert advisory committee for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government said during a press conference May 13 that the variant from India may be as much as 50 percent more transmissible than the B.1.1.7 variant, which was first identified in the U.K. However more research is needed, experts say.\r\nVaccines beat the variants\r\nBhattacharya, who has lost two family members in India to Covid-19 in recent weeks, is not worried that the changes in this particular variant could render the vaccines ineffective. Even if there are breakthrough infections among vaccinated people, they\'ll be in better shape, he said.\r\n\r\n“This variant seems like it\'s probably picked up some things that make it more transmissible and that is definitely an area of concern,” he said.\r\nShane Crotty, a virologist and professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, is optimistic that the vaccines will ultimately prove effective against this variant in the real world, as well as in a lab study.\r\n\r\nIn a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from Qatar found the Pfizer vaccine to be 97 percent effective in preventing severe disease and death in patients infected by any form of the coronavirus, including the variants.\r\n\r\n“The fact that there is real-world data that shows the Pfizer vaccine works very well against the South African variant, it\'s quite likely that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be very effective against these new Indian variants, as well,” Crotty said.', '2021-05-14', '58', 'Marta Young', 1),

It’s a method that uses no soil, 95% less water than traditional farming, and isn’t affected by the weather.\r\n\r\n“Vertical Farming does not need land. All it needs is space. If one woman or two can get space from the community they can build their own Vertical Farm, meaning that they can be independent thereafter for their families and for themselves,\" explains President of the African Association for Vertical Farming, Josephine Favre.\r\n\r\n\"If you are able to give an African woman that opportunity, to feed her family, then use whatever is surplus to make an enterprise, I think that is spot on.”\r\nFunding female entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nThe World Bank estimates that agribusiness in Sub-Saharan Africa will be worth 1 trillion US dollars (€904 billion) by the year 2030.\r\n\r\nMore than a quarter of women in Sub-Saharan Africa are already entrepreneurs - the highest rate globally.\r\n\r\nBut African women face a $20 billion dollar (€18.06 billion) financing gap, meaning they are hugely disadvantaged in growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nFormer London-based lawyer Grace Camara is harnessing the power of the African diaspora to combat this.\r\n\r\nShe set up the Remitfund, an investment fund where Africans sending money back home contribute a small percentage.\r\n\r\nThe money is then invested in entrepreneurs with social enterprise businesses in Africa from agriculture to tech and fashion.\r\n\"African fashion is like the cool thing now, a lot of it is featured on the catwalk so for me, this was really an opportunity to look at how we could support those fashion designers to bring their manufacturing base back to the continent,\" says Camara.\r\n\r\n\" With millions of followers on Instagram and selling to celebrities around the world, we could potentially create between 50 to 100 jobs.

(30, '\r\nAlcohol in Moderation May Help the Heart by Calming Stress Signals in the Brain', 'Moderate alcohol intake -- defined as no more than one alcoholic drink for women and two for men per day -- has been associated with a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease when compared with individuals who abstain from drinking or partake in excessive drinking, according to a new study.', '\"We found that stress-related activity in the brain was higher in non-drinkers when compared with people who drank moderately, while people who drank excessively (more than 14 drinks per week) had the highest level of stress-related brain activity,\" said Kenechukwu Mezue, MD, a fellow in nuclear cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the study\'s lead author. \"The thought is that moderate amounts of alcohol may have effects on the brain that can help you relax, reduce stress levels and, perhaps through these mechanisms, lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mezue was quick to caution that these findings should not encourage alcohol use, he said they could open doors to new therapeutics or prescribing stress-relieving activities like exercise or yoga to help minimize stress signals in the brain.\r\n\r\n\"The current study suggests that moderate alcohol intake beneficially impacts the brain-heart connection. However, alcohol has several important side effects, including an increased risk of cancer, liver damage and dependence, so other interventions with better side effect profiles that beneficially impact brain-heart pathways are needed,\" Mezue said.\r\n\r\nIn a related study by the same research team (which is also being presented at ACC.21), exercise was found to have a similar effect on brain activity as well as on the incidence of cardiovascular disease and events. The authors said exercise is associated with decreased stress-associated brain activity in a dose-dependent manner. While the connection between stress and heart disease is widely accepted, the authors said relatively little research has been done on how modifying stress may help protect heart health.\r\n\r\nData were obtained from the Mass General Brigham Biobank health care survey of 53,064 participants, of which 59.9% were women and the average age was 57.2 years. Alcohol intake was based on self-report and was classified as low (<1 drink/week), moderate (1-14 drinks/week) or high (>14 drinks/week). Major adverse cardiovascular events, including heart attack, stroke or related hospitalizations, were determined using diagnostic (ICD) codes.\r\n\r\nOf the patients included, 752 underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, or PET imaging, which is often used as part of cancer screening but can also show areas in the brain that have increased activity. The scans allowed researchers to objectively measure activity in regions of the brain known to be associated with stress. Researchers assessed stress-related brain activity by measuring the activity of the amygdala (the part of the brain associated with fear and stress) and dividing it by activity in the frontal cortex (the part of the brain involved in executive functions). They then grouped patients based on the extent of brain stress activity.\r\n\r\nOf the 53,064 participants, 7,905 (15%) experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event: 17% in the low alcohol intake group and 13% in the moderate alcohol intake group. People who reported moderate alcohol intake were found to have a 20% lower chance of having a major event compared to low alcohol intake (in adjusted analysis), and also had lower stress-related brain activity. This remained significant even after controlling for demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, socioeconomic variables and psychological factors.\r\n\r\n\"Previous studies by our group and others have shown a robust association between heightened amygdalar activity and a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart attack, stroke or death. In the current study, path analyses showed that the link between moderate alcohol intake and lowered cardiovascular event risk is significantly mediated though reductions in amygdalar activity,\" Mezue said.\r\n\r\nThe study is limited due to the self-reporting of alcohol intake based on the average consumption of drinks per week. The data is also from a single center, and each participant in the imaging sub-study only received a single brain scan. Further study would be needed to show that the observed reductions in brain activity are the direct result of moderate alcohol intake through repeated brain scans and more detailed alcohol intake assessments over time.', '2021-04-02', '63', 'Adam Holmes', 1),

Risk is affected by prevailing weather conditions.\r\n\r\nBut meteorological data are extensive and complex, and machine learning has the potential to pick up associations not identified by conventional one-dimensional statistical approaches, say the Japanese researchers.\r\nTo explore this further, they assessed the capacity of machine learning to predict daily out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, using daily weather (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, snowfall, cloud cover, wind speed and atmospheric pressure readings) and timing (year, season, day of the week, hour of the day, and public holidays) data.\r\n\r\nOf 1,299,784 cases occurring between 2005 and 2013, machine learning was applied to 525,374, using either weather or timing data, or both (training dataset).\r\n\r\nThe results were then compared with 135,678 cases occurring in 2014-15 to test the accuracy of the model for predicting the number of daily cardiac arrests in other years (testing dataset).\r\n\r\nAnd to see how accurate the approach might be at the local level, the researchers carried out a \'heatmap analysis,\' using another dataset drawn from the location of out of hospital cardiac arrests in Kobe city between January 2016 and December 2018.\r\n\r\nThe combination of weather and timing data most accurately predicted an out of hospital cardiac arrest in both the training and testing datasets.\r\nIt predicted that Sundays, Mondays, public holidays, winter, low temperatures and sharp temperature drops within and between days were more strongly associated with cardiac arrest than either the weather or timing data alone.\r\n\r\nThe researchers acknowledge that they didn\'t have detailed information on the location of cardiac arrests except in Kobe city, nor did they have any data on pre-existing medical conditions, both of which may have influenced the results.\r\n\r\nBut they suggest: \"Our predictive model for daily incidence of [out of hospital cardiac arrest] is widely generalisable for the general population in developed countries, because this study had a large sample size and used comprehensive meteorological data.\"\r\n\r\nThey add: \"The methods developed in this study serve as an example of a new model for predictive analytics that could be applied to other clinical outcomes of interest related to life-threatening acute cardiovascular disease.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they conclude: \"This predictive model may be useful for preventing [out of hospital cardiac arrest] and improving the prognosis of patients...via a warning system for citizens and [emergency medical services] on high-risk days in the future.\"\r\n\r\nIn a linked editorial, Dr David Foster Gaieski, of Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, agrees.\r\n\r\n\"Knowing what the weather will most likely be in the coming week can generate \'cardiovascular emergency warnings\' for people at risk -- notifying the elderly and others about upcoming periods of increased danger similar to how weather data are used to notify people of upcoming hazardous road conditions during winter storms,\" he explains.\r\n\r\n\"These predictions can be used for resource deployment, scheduling and planning so that emergency medical services systems, emergency department resuscitation resources, and cardiac catheterisation laboratory staff are aware of, and prepared for, the number of expected [cases] during the coming days,\" he adds.', '2021-05-12', '64', 'Adrienne Jones', 1),

Modern therapy of acne is based not only on the use of specific drugs, but also on ‘complementary’ products, such as moisturizers, cleansers, and sunscreens.”\r\nPatients with oily skin should use a highly rinsable product with no residual moisturizer. These products include those based on sodium lauryl sulfate, according to the researchers. They recommend that patients with dry skin or skin damaged by the sun or smoke use a noncomedogenic moisturizing liquid cleanser.\r\n\r\nDaily facial cleansing is important for acne care and should be done twice a day, and use of aggressive and strong surfactants should be avoided because of their strongly alkaline pH, according to the investigators. Available cleansing options include cleansing milk, cold cream, cleansing oils, cleansing balms, micellar water cleansers, nonfoaming cleansers, and foaming cleansers.\r\n\r\nSun exposure affects progression of acne, because it can promote bacterial proliferation and reduce immune response, leading to inflammation. “Therefore, it is essential to explain the importance of sun protection to the patient,” noted the study authors. “In this regard, light and nonocclusive products, in the form of sprays, gels, or liquids, should be preferred.”\r\n\r\nMakeup may provide quick results for covering acne, but it should be removed at night, and cosmetics such as colored creams and concealers should be oil-free and noncomedogenic, advised the researchers. Sonic cleansing supports are increasingly used for daily care such as removing makeup or sunscreens, and cleansing with the sonic brush may be beneficial for inflammatory skin conditions.\r\n\r\nTreatment for patients with acne should include education about proper daily skin hygiene, including protection from environmental damage, according to the study authors.\r\n\r\n“Cleansers should stay on the skin as briefly as possible to minimize damage to the stratum corneum proteins,” the researchers recommended. “However, this brief contact does not allow the various components of the cleansers to penetrate and remain in the skin. A solution may be to carry out a double cleansing, first with an oil-based cleanser, then with a water-based or surfactant-based cleanser. It is used to easily remove makeup, impurities, and oily residues, allowing the detergent to penetrate deeper, for a better level of cleansing.”\r\n', '2021-04-10', '68', 'Jessica Rawden', 1),

Strategies to prevent heart disease and stroke should begin in childhood to promote better brain health by middle age.', 'Many diseases that cause neurological deficits, such as Alzheimer\'s, have a long preclinical phase before noticeable symptoms begin, so finding links between childhood obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors is important for cognitive health.

More than 2,000 of the participants, ranging in ages from 34 to 49, underwent a computerized cognitive function test in 2011. The test measured four different cognitive domains: episodic memory and associative learning; short-term working memory; reaction and movement time; and visual processing and sustained attention.\r\n\r\nResearchers found:\r\n\r\nSystolic blood pressure, total blood cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as well as body mass index, from childhood to midlife are associated with brain function in middle age.\r\nConsistently high systolic blood pressure or high blood total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were linked to worse memory and learning by midlife when compared with lower measures.\r\nObesity from childhood to adulthood was associated with lower visual information processing speed and maintaining attention.\r\nHaving all three cardiovascular risk factors was linked to poorer memory and associative learning, worse visual processing, decreased attention span, and slower reaction and movement time.\r\nThese results are from observational findings, so more studies are needed to learn whether there are specific ages in childhood and/or adolescence when cardiovascular risk factors are particularly important to brain health in adulthood. Study limitations include that a definite cause-and-effect link between cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive performance cannot be determined in this type of population-based study; cognition was measured at a single point in time; and because all study participants are white, the results may not be generalizable to people from other racial or ethnic groups.', '2021-04-08', '65', 'Nicholas Anthem ', 1),

To date there are no drugs that have a substantial positive impact on either the prevention or reversal of cognitive decline. A growing body of evidence finds that targeting lifestyle and vascular risk factors have a beneficial effect on overall cognitive performance. A new review in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease, published by IOS Press, examines research that finds spiritual fitness, a new concept in medicine that centers on psychological and spiritual wellbeing, and Kirtan Kriya, a simple 12-minute meditative practice, may reduce multiple risk factors for AD.\r\n\"The key point of this review is that making a commitment to a brain longevity lifestyle, including spiritual fitness, is a critically important way for aging Alzheimer\'s disease free,\" explain authors Dharma Singh Khalsa, MD, Alzheimer\'s Research and Prevention Foundation, Tucson, AZ, USA, and Andrew B. Newberg, MD, Department of Integrative Medicine and Nutritional Sciences, Department of Radiology, Marcus Institute of Integrative Health, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. \"We hope this article will inspire scientists, clinicians, and patients to embrace this new concept of spiritual fitness and make it a part of every multidomain program for the prevention of cognitive disability.\"\r\n\r\nResearch reveals that religious and spiritual involvement can preserve cognitive function as we age. The authors observe that today, spirituality is often experienced outside the context of an organized religion and may be part of every religion or separate to it. Spiritual fitness is a new dimension in AD prevention, interweaving basic, psychological and spiritual wellbeing. The authors discuss the research on how these factors affect brain function and cognition. For example, psychological wellbeing may reduce inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and disability. Significantly, individuals who have a high score on a \"purpose in life\" (PIL) measure, a component of psychological wellbeing, were 2.4 times more likely to remain free of AD than individuals with low PIL. In another study, participants who reported higher levels of PIL exhibited better cognitive function, and further, PIL protected those with already existing pathological conditions, thus slowing their decline.\r\n\r\nStress and stress management are under-discussed topics in AD prevention, yet the authors point out that there is ample evidence that physical, psychological, and emotional effects of stress may elevate AD risk. Kirtan Kriya (KK) is a 12-minute singing meditation that involves four sounds, breathing, and repetitive finger movements. It has multiple documented effects on stress, such as improving sleep, decreasing depression, and increasing wellbeing. It has also been found to increase blood flow to areas of the brain involved in cognition and emotional regulation and increases grey matter volume and decreases ventricular size in long-term practitioners, which may slow brain aging. Research in healthy individuals, caregivers, and those with cognitive decline found that the practice improves cognition, slows memory loss, and improves mood.\r\n\r\nThe overall relationship between spiritual fitness and a person\'s complete physical and mental health is a topic of investigation in the emerging field of study called neurotheology. Early work has focused on the development of models regarding which brain areas are affected through spiritual practices such as meditation or prayer. Over the last 20 years, there has been an extensive growth in neuroimaging and other physiological studies evaluating the effect of meditation, spiritual practices, and mystical experiences. A neuroimaging study of KK found long term brain effects, during meditation and afterwards. Neurotheological studies can help understanding of how a practice such as KK can lead to more permanent effects in brain function that support spiritual fitness, according to Dr. Khalsa and Dr. Newberg.\r\n\r\n\"Mitigating the extensive negative biochemical effects of stress with meditation practices, in tandem with the creation of heightened levels of spiritual fitness, may help lower the risk of AD. Small shifts in one\'s daily routine can make all the difference in AD prevention,\" Dr. Khalsa and Dr. Newberg conclude. \"We are optimistic this article will inspire future research on the topic of spiritual fitness and AD.\"', '2021-02-19', '71', 'Jenny Manoban', 1),

These gains in hepatic health are mediated through modification of inter-organ cross-talk, circulatory organokine alterations and reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress.', 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disorder worldwide, affecting as much as a quarter of humanity. It is characterized by fat accumulation in liver cells and may progress to inflammation, cirrhosis and liver failure. Now, researchers at the University of Tsukuba reveal the positive effects, beyond the expected weight-loss benefit, of exercise on the liver.\r\nNAFLD is associated with unhealthy behaviors such as overeating and a sedentary lifestyle. In Japan 41% of middle-aged men have NAFLD and 25% will progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatic dysfunction.\r\n\r\nWeight reduction is fundamental to NAFLD management. Unfortunately, achieving a targeted bodyweight without supervision is difficult, and maintaining this over time even more so. Hitherto, exercise was considered adjunctive to dietary restrictions for weight loss but the other benefits such as reduced hepatic steatosis (fatty change) and stiffness are being increasingly recognized. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\r\n\r\n\"We compared data from obese Japanese men with NAFLD on a 3-month exercise regimen with those on dietary restriction targeting weight loss,\" senior author Professor Junichi Shoda explains. \"We tracked hepatic parameters, reduction in adipose tissue, increase in muscle strength, reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress, changes in organokine concentrations, and expression of target genes of Nrf2, an oxidative stress sensor.\"\r\n\r\nThe researchers found that exercise preserved muscle mass better, though with modest decrease of body and fat mass. Remarkably, ultrasound elastography revealed that the exercise regimen reduced liver steatosis by an additional 9.5%, liver stiffness by an additional 6.8%, and the FibroScan-AST Score (a measure of liver fibrosis) by an additional 16.4% over the weight-loss regimen.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the exercise regimen altered the circulating concentrations of specific organokines and apparently induced anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress responses through activation of the Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2), an oxidative stress sensor. It also enhanced the phagocytic capacity of Kupffer cells which help maintain liver function.\r\n\r\nProfessor Shoda explains the relevance of their findings. \"Our research shows how exercise prevents liver steatosis and fibrosis in NAFLD and clarifies that this benefit is compounded by preservation of muscle mass and is independent of weight changes. Patients on exercise regimens may become demotivated and drop out if they do not experience significant weight loss. Therefore, moderate to vigorous intensity exercise should be integrated in all NAFLD therapeutic regimens, and patients at risk for NASH should be encouraged to persevere with moderate to high intensity exercise regardless of whether or not they lose weight.\"', '2021-03-18', '74', 'Sarah El-Mahmoud', 1),

Look to the Art on Your Walls for Fresh Inspiration.', 'Simply looking at art comes with a slew of mental health benefits.', 'As the pandemic continues, and the seasons pass by, and we are still stuck working in the confines of our home, it’s understandable that your mind turns off, ideas stop flowing, and you find yourself stuck in rut. Now is the perfect time then to switch things up and bring newness into your life, and by life, we mean your walls.\r\n\r\nSure looking at your walls right now may do absolutely nothing for you … in fact, they may totally bore you. So why not take this opportunity to find a piece of art that inspires you, that excites you, and generally makes you happy? Make your space beautiful by purchasing pieces from Fine Art America.\r\n\r\nWe all have heard that creating art can lift our mood, allow our imaginations to run wild, and help us to tap into our resourcefulness and ingenuity. But, did you know just looking at art comes with its own range of benefits? A study at the University of London showed that viewing artwork can generate in the brain the same reactions as being in love (without the trials and tribulations of a relationship!). Time in an art museum can improve our critical thinking. Simply looking at art that appeals to us can relieve stress. It can provide an escape, however brief, from this crazy world around us.\r\nOf course, as individuals, our tastes are as wide-ranging as our personalities. Finding the piece or pieces that inspire you may sound daunting, but once you start to peruse the multitude of works that Fine Art America has to offer, we’re convinced you will find the process outright enjoyable. From posters to paintings, framed prints and canvas prints, you’ll discover the works of hundreds of thousands of independent artists. You will be able to shop for wall art by room, theme, medium, product type, and/or color palette. And if you have a hard time deciding what is going to look best on your wall, and which wall will benefit most, don’t worry! Fine Art America has an app for that! Its augmented reality-powered mobile app lets you envision what that piece is going to look like, hanging in all its splendor, before you commit to buying it.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the coin, if you\'re an up-and-coming artist looking for a platform to display and sell your work, Fine Art America gives artists the opportunity to showcase their pieces, and do custom markups, unlike many other competitors.\r\nWhether your home office is actually an office, or a corner of your dining room table, a nook in the kitchen, or a portion of your bedroom, brighten up the space and get yourself motivated, unleash your own creativity, and let the thoughts flow. You may not be able to get out to an art gallery right now, but you can still appreciate and welcome what art has to offer. Fine Art America will deliver your artwork directly to your door, wherever you may be in the world.

(42, 'THE 30 BEST INDOOR PLANTS FOR APARTMENTS TO BUY ONLINE', '\r\nWith a little love and some water, these indoor plants can make it anywhere.', 'Living in a small apartment and being a gardening enthusiast were once mutually exclusive. The too-often dark, damp, or overly dry environments are not exactly the most ideal for those looking to turn their living room into a makeshift greenhouse. However, this no longer needs to be the case, as there is a wide array of plant species that are actually perfectly suited for surviving—and even thriving—in less-than-tropical conditions. So we at ELLE Decor tapped Baltimore-based plant stylist Hilton Carter, author of last year’s Wild Interiors, to recommend the best indoor apartment plants that you can buy online, and also to tell you how to care for them once they’re all yours. Read on for his top picks, as well as some of our own.\r\nPHILODENDRON NARROW “JUNGLE BOOGIE” IN 4-INCH POT “Like all philodendrons, you have to be careful to not overwater it,” says Carter. “Only give it a drink when the soil is completely dry. When it comes to light, it likes it bright or medium and indirect.”\r\nLIPSTICK PLANT “It’s easy to see where this got its name,” says Carter. “It thrives in bright indirect light but will also do well in filtered light. Be careful not to overexpose it to direct sun, because this can burn the leaves and dry the plant out. Keep the soil moist, not wet. For balanced growth, rotate it at least once a month.”\r\nHOYA RUBRA KRIMSON PRINCESS “Also known as the Crimson Prince, like other hoyas, this trailing beauty is perfect for displaying in a window that gets bright but indirect light,” says Carter. “They love humidity, so try misting it once a week and let the soil dry between waterings. Repot during the spring or summer when the roots start peeking out of the drainage hole.”\r\nPILEA PEPEROMIOIDES “This is a widely loved plant with many endearing nicknames like UFO plant, pancake plant, and Chinese money plant,” says Carter. “Its love of humidity makes it a great way to add color to a bathroom. The sprouted leafy discs could also work in any space with bright indirect light. Let the soil dry out between waterings to avoid root rot. Their leaves will droop a bit when they are thirsty.”\r\nJADE “This is one of my favorite succulents to grow indoors. Unlike other plants, it can survive a day of direct sunlight,” says Carter. “Place it in a pot with a drainage hole and water every two weeks only when the top two inches of soil are dry. To keep it looking fresh, just give dying or dry branches a snip.”\r\nHOYA CARNOSA VARIEGATA “This waxy-leafed beauty will do best in an area of your home that gets bright indirect light,” says Carter. “Direct sunlight will kill the plant over time. Only water it when the soil is dry, but do spray it with mist weekly because their leaves love humidity.”\r\n \r\n', '2021-02-18', '83', ' Natasha Wynarczyk', 3),

Jimin almost didn’t debut in BTS\r\nIn an episode of JTBC’s Please Take Care of My Refrigerator, Jimin revealed that he almost didn’t debut because of his dancing skills.

Jimin shared that the dancing he majored in was a lot different from the dancing idol groups do.\r\n4.

(48, 'At Home: Making the Most of Lighting Can Keep Moods Lifted', 'Summer allowed many of us to get out of our homes more despite the pandemic.', 'Sunset is arriving noticeably earlier, meaning less mood-lifting daylight for everyone. The weather is turning colder, so we’ll soon spend even more time cooped up inside the homes where we’ve huddled, and sometimes completely quarantined, for six months.\r\nMany of us are working and studying at home by day, then trying to shift into relaxation mode in the very same rooms at night. And we’re doing all of this while battling the many stresses that 2020 keeps on delivering.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was an autumn when things could be a bit brighter, this is it.\r\n\r\nSo while better light bulbs or a repositioned lamp won’t solve everything, it’s a great year to reassess the way your home is lit -- and possibly make some changes.\r\nDIFFERENTIATE NIGHT FROM DAY\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to step away from work or school when you’re living in your workspace. One way to shift the mood and tell your body and brain that it’s time to relax is to change the lighting when day becomes night.\r\n\r\nBy day, use lightbulbs that mimic daylight (about 5000 Kelvin). Virginia-based architect Warren Ralston says this is usually the lighting we see in offices, because its cool white hue offers plenty of energizing brightness.\r\n\r\nSmart LED bulbs can be set to this brightness in the morning and kept there all day.\r\n\r\n“Another great thing about 5000K daylight LED is how well it works for video conferencing,” says Atlanta-based interior designer Brian Patrick Flynn. “Anytime I’m working from home, I turn on the overhead LEDs and it eliminates yellowy shadows from the videos.”\r\n\r\nWhen your workday is over, switch to lamps and fixtures fitted with traditional warm bulbs or set your smart bulbs to a lower intensity (about 3000-3500 Kelvin, or as low as 2500 for very warm light).\r\n\r\nMany types of smart lightbulbs can be adjusted easily with a remote control or through an app, Flynn says. “This is hugely helpful for creating ambience and warmth versus using pure daylight for work purposes.”\r\n\r\nYou can also set your lights on timers, so your preferred evening lighting comes on automatically.\r\n\r\nLIGHT YOUR THINGS, NOT YOUR ROOMS\r\n\r\nBrightening up your home may be about repositioning the lights you already have, rather than adding more.\r\n\r\n“Light has to reflect off of something in order for your eyes to perceive that light,” Ralston explains. “So you don’t really light a space. You light a surface. You’re lighting a wall or a floor or an object.”\r\n\r\nTry positioning lamps or overhead lights so the light bounces off items you want to highlight, or off surfaces like a glossy tabletop or lustrous fabric.\r\n\r\nConsider rearranging furniture and art to make better use of the light coming from ceiling fixtures and sconces.\r\n\r\nRalston sometimes uses virtual reality technology to show clients what a room will look like at different times of day, and how lighting options would look paired with different furnishings. He says they’re often surprised at how different the light looks depending on what surfaces surround it.\r\n\r\nWARM YOUR SPACE WITH FIRELIGHT\r\n\r\nIn the fall, lighting a few logs in a traditional fireplace is a great way to shift the mood in your home. And if you don’t have a fireplace, you can still enjoy that same warmth and flickering light, says designer and sculptor Elena Colombo, who creates fire features that range from elaborate outdoor installations to delicate tabletop fire bowls.\r\n\r\nA small fire bowl can be used on a coffee table or as a centerpiece on a dining-room table to create a warm, welcoming, flickering light that’s a step beyond what candles offer, Colombo says. Many fire bowls burn an alcohol-based gel that requires no ventilation.\r\n\r\n“As soon as your eye sees the flame,” she says, “it just changes your mood.”\r\n\r\nWhen choosing your source of indoor firelight, just be sure to follow any fire safety restrictions where you live.\r\n\r\nAnd when night falls, Colombo suggests switching on a few low-wattage lights near the door to your deck or patio. Just having a view of your warmly lit outdoor space can keep you from feeling penned in on a dark autumn night. It will make your home feel more expansive, and maybe even inspire you to grab a sweater and sit out under the stars.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
